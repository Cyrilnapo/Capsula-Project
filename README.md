# Capsula-Project
üåê First "real" project ever. In IT Pre-apprenticeship

## What is it ?
I made a local website where you can post a "time capsule" (saved in a database) with text, photos, videos and a expiration date when you will be able to open it again. 

+Profiles with signup login syszem, capsules linked to profiles, editing profiles and some other stuff

## How good is it ?
Not very good. I made it with no knowledges at all, learned everything while doing it (i was in pre-apprenticeship and my prize list was a static website and a login php form)
